# Assembly-Game-in-C
A game that my team and I built as extension to my C project in year one of my Computing degree.

Here's a video of the final game:

We used the SDL library in C to create the game, which allows users to input assembly language to achieve the goal shown on the screen. These goals and initial set ups were based on the test cases that were given to us in the assignment. In the game, the portals represent registers, with the values stored in the registers displayed on top of the portal. Similarly, eggs represent constants that are given at the beginning of the game, that the user has to fully utilise to achieve the goal.Â The movement of birds would visualise the execution of the line of assembly code written by the user. There is also a PC counter that implies the number of lines of assemnbly code the user has to input.

The entire project involved building an emulator and assembler for a subset of the ARM instruction set architecture. However, due to privacy issues, I have only made the code for our extension public on Github.
